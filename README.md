## Introduction

Auspice is an open-source interactive web app for visualising phylogenomic data.
It is the app that powers all the vlisualisation on [nextstrain.org](https://nextstrain.org), which aims to provide a continually-updated view of publicly available pathogen genome data.
Auspice was designed to aid epidemiological understanding and improve outbreak response, but is able to visualise a diverse range of datasets.


**Please see [nextstrain.github.io/auspice](https://nextstrain.github.io/auspice) for further details.**


## Installation

```bash
npm install -g auspice
```
See [here](https://nextstrain.github.io/auspice/installation) for more details.


## Running Auspice

`auspice view` starts the server, which makes local datasets available in a browser at  [localhost:4000/local](http://localhost:4000/local).

By default, the datasets are sourced from the current working directory (or an **auspice** subfolder if it exists).
Please run `auspice view -h` to see how to change this directory, as well as the directory where narratives are sourced from.
