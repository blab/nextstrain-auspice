title: Input file formats

> Incomplete

This page defines the format of the dataset JSONs and narratives which auspice consumes.
If you are running auspice locally, these are the only files you need to worry about.

**Auspice is agnostic about the data it visualises** -- they don't have to be viral genomes, or real-time, or generated in Augur.
They do, however have to be in a specific file format.
Here we will explain this format and provide different ways to get your data into this format.

> If you are interested in visualising newick trees, possible with CSV/TSV metadata files, then you may want to use auspice.us which lets you drag & drop your files onto the browser ðŸ™Œ

## Dataset files

* main (v2) unified JSONs
* additional files (tip-frequencies is the only one I think)
* provide a way to download some examples

* links to augur / walkthroughts
* BEAST -> JSON docs
* [v2 schema](https://github.com/nextstrain/augur/blob/master/augur/data/schema.json)
* [augur](https://nextstrain.org/docs/bioinformatics/introduction)


## Narrative files





## Out of date file formats
* `auspice convert` can convert v1 to v2 JSONs
