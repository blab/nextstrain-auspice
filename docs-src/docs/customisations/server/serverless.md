title: Deploying auspice without a server

> This API is experimental. Most probably it will change dramatically over the coming weeks.

## Serverless builds

You may also choose to forego the server and hardcode the paths to the datasets.
For an example of this see [github.com/blab/ZEBOV](https://github.com/blab/ZEBOV) -- specifically [this part](https://github.com/blab/ZEBOV/blob/master/auspiceCustomisations/config.json#L3) of the auspice config.
