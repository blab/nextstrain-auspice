Auspice.us is a [custom build of auspice](build-server/introduction.md) which allows users to simply drag & drop datasets onto the browser.
It also serves datasets from a GitHub, i.e. datasets which you have committed to a public github repository can be automatically visualised through auspice.us -- see [community-builds](auspice-us/community-builds.md) for instructions.

> How does community-build with auspice.us differ from a nextstrain community build? How is ti different from a custom server or static site with links to GitHub? -Cassia
